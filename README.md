WindTurbineHighSpeedBearingPrognosis-Data

This dataset is taken from a 2MW wind turbine high speed shaft with a measurement taken for 50 consecutive days (the 5 download links below contain 10 days of data each). The bearing has an inner race fault which is increasing in severity across the 50 day period. The high speed shaft is driven by a 20 tooth pinion gear. See publication link for further details.
